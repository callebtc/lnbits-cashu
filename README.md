## ⚠️ Deprecation warning

This repository is not currently **not maintained** and the extension is not fully up to date with the Cashu spec. As an alternative, install [Nutshell](https://github.com/cashubtc/nutshell) and either connect it directly to your funding source (LND/CLN/...) or use LNbits as a funding source for it.

Maybe one day we might pick up this project again but in the mean time: do not use it.
